# Smallest Difference

Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

# Non-Constructible Change

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you **cannot** create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren’t necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you’re given coins = `[1, 2, 5]`, the minimum amount of change that you can’t create is `4`. If you’re given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can’t create is 1.
